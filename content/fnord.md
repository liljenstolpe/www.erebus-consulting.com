## What Are You Looking For? ##
We're sure it doesn't exist.  Why don't you just move [along](http://www.asgaard.org).

## Fnords Don't Exist ##
So why are you looking for them?  Trust us, there are no Fnords.  Let us show you 
[something](http://www.asgaard.org) much more to your liking.

## Why Do You Persist ##
<style type="text/css">
   a.rollover span {
      display: inline;
   }
   a.rollover:hover span {
      display: none;
   }
   a.rollover img {
      display: none;
   }
   a.rollover:hover img {
      display: inline;
   }
</style>
Even if Fnords theoretically existed
(<a class="rollover" href="#"><span>trust us</span>
<img src="/img/tuskegee.jpg" width="200" alt="Trusting men of Tuskegee"
title="The Trusting Men of Tuskegee"/></a>, 
they don't) it probably wouldn't be productive
to look for them.  In fact, it may even be contrary to your best interests.  It's well past the time
that you should be [moving along](http://www.asgaard.org).

## Now You've Done It ##
We're very sorry, but we've had to notify
<a class="rollover" href="#"><span>The Authorities</span>
<img src="/img/mib.png" width="200" alt="the Men in Black"
title="The Authorities"/></a>
It's best if you just sit down and relax now.
Trying to [run](http://www.asgaard.org/) will just etiolate you.
This will all be over soon, we promise.
